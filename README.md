# A Simple Bug Tracker Website

A simple way to keep track of bugs in code.

## Description

This project was basically about creating a “website” where I could potentially track bugs I have on projects for me or for others at some point.
Coding was done in React, JS, CSS, HTML
A simple bug tracker with a login and priority tracking
Still needs some work with the design of the web page
Sadly with all the errors with version differences from my guides and my version, I was sadly not able to get to the backend.


### Getting the Progam Started

To open the website (cd) to the frontend folder in src/code/frontend and then type the cmd npm start, and it should automatically open the local website in a default browser.

### Dependencies

* Some prerequisites to run this project could be to have React and its dependencies downloaded in your computer
